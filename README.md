# Simple Gravity Simulation Game

This is a simple **Gravity Simulation** built with **Pygame**. The game simulates gravity on circles that are created at the mouse click position, allowing them to bounce on the ground.

## Features
- **Gravity Simulation**: Circles fall under the influence of gravity and bounce when they hit the ground.
- **Dynamic Velocity Display**: Shows the current velocity of the most recently created circle.
- **Interactive**: Click to create circles and observe their behavior.

## Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x**
- **Pygame**: Install using:
  ```bash
  pip install pygame
  
## Running the Game
- Clone or download the repository.
- Navigate to the project directory.
- Run the script:
```bash
python simple_gravity.py
```
